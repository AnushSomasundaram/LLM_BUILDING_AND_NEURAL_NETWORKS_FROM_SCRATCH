make more : - make more of something

Under the hood make more is a character leveel language model. It treats 
lines a sequence of characters . Modeling sequences of character and we 
have to predict next character in the sequence.

makemore : Bigram, bag of words, mlp, rnn, GRU, transformer. 

names.txt is a file with names

['emma',
 'olivia',
 'ava',
 'isabella',
 'sophia',
 'charlotte',
 'mia',
 'amelia',
 'harper',
 'evelyn']


every single word  has a bunch of examples inside an example.

in isabella we can say that a comes after s .... and the word ends with a and so on and so forth
we can model the structure.


we're going to star with building a bigram language model, in a bigram languag emodel we're only worried about working with 2 characters at a time.
